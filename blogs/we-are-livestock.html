I give unto you this inalienable truth. There are beings that inhabit our minds, that use us, control us, for their benefit. Each of us puppets to these invisible puppet masters.

Perhaps one of the biggest fears of man, is to lose agency over oneself, which is also why ‘free will’ is one of the most pervasive narratives we have been telling ourselves for millennia. To imbue this with even greater terror, is to lose our agency to another, especially if it is something that’s burrowed into our brains. This explains the fascination of sci-fi literature with mind controlling, brain inhabiting parasites.
But is there more to this than merely fiction? Do these “parasites” actually exist?
Not in the conventional sense at least, but if the effects are the same, does it really matter if they are physical bugs or something else altogether?

We inhabit this world, and we sustain ourselves with the fruits that are borne by this physical substrate, and seek shelter in the many folds in its skin. We reproduce, and change the environment around us according to our whims and fancies. This is the case with every living organism. What if there was a substrate that was not physical in the strictest sense? What if there are beings that lay their roots down into this undergirding? That affect and are affected by this plane they inhabit? What if they also had the innate instinct to proliferate? Would this being be considered a living being as well?

For all definitions we associate to what a “living being” is, they must apply to all things that fit this definition regardless of which realm they inhabit, physical or otherwise.

To establish the existence of these organisms, I shall rely on an unlikely trinity; Foucault’s Archaeology of Thought, Jung’s Collective Unconscious, and Darwin’s Natural Selection. The rest of the essay will follow a logical map;
if A, B, and C, are true, then the conclusion must be self evident.

A. Foucault mentions how different modes of thought are not exactly improvements of previous though structures, they are just, as is, different. Each grid lets a certain spectrum of information through and suppresses others.
The key contention lies with the conventional understanding of how knowledge progresses in an upward fashion, i.e. the most recent discourse has all things expressed in previous discourses encompassed within itself, and some more. The newest, baddest bitch of discourses on the street.

But he defines it as grids instead, overlaid on top of the human experience. Some grids may cover/reveal what others do not. That which colored our lenses in the middle ages are not worse than the ones we have right now, we just see differently.
The central idea along which the libidinal energy economy is directed, that central ideology, is the grid. Of course the analogy of grids is distorted, as it implies there is an experience beyond these grids. The nuance is that there exists nothing beyond these grids.
Similar to consciousness, which is at its theoretical center, just a direction, pointed such that all orthogonal vectors to this get suppressed. Foucault theorized the “Collective Consciousness”.

B. We now move on to the Collective Unconscious.
There are biological structures we inherited across millions of years of evolution, insofar this much is obvious. The natural extension to this is that the physical substrate upon which the psychic environment we inhabit must also have inherited characteristics, that is universal to all human beings, and with shared similarities beyond our species as well.

In continuation there exists an interface, between the biological substrate and the psychological realm that we inhabit. The interface, although not perfect, allows us to observe and understand the wireframes that guide our existence. These “knots” in our nervous system are what are expressed as archetypes, which erupt throughout the course of human history as religious symbols, political dogma, and even in schizo episodes.

These symbols and the space they inhabit along all else archetypal and universal, is the Collective Unconscious.

SuperOrganisms are the selfsame described “grids” above, Foucalt just failed to see the grids as objects in motion and instead stopped at their stasis, perhaps that was sufficient for his aims.

A and B together combine to form the stasis of the argument, and C, Natural Selection, will be employed for the dynamics.

If it is true that each ‘grid’ is a new ideological view of the world, and they are chronologically ordered as X1, X2, ….., Xn, then Xn is directly impacted by Xn-1 and other external factors. But since Xn-1 itself was also a direct product of external factors and going back inductively, all things are an evolution of the central starting point of X1. All Xs after this are morphologically contingent on X1, and that a product of the biological substrate that birthed it in the first place.

C. Assertion: “ideas” most closely aligned with the physical substrate proliferate and expand more successfully.

We shall approach this assertion without a teleological argument. A pure survivorship argument is sufficient to establish why there at least “appears” to be a natural force to proliferate. The “ideas” incur random changes that gear them towards more effective proliferation and they exhibit their existence more commonly than the ones that don’t. Physical substrate alignment and its benefits can be observed analogous to successful adaptations by biological organisms to their environment. “Ideas” imbued with an urge to proliferate, also incur random mutations in physical substrate alignment that due to sheer randomness have a stronger ability to spread into more crevices of their environment.

These SuperOrganisms, who’s existence we have established and the barest behaviors described, that operate on a layer abstracted above us, sufficiently evolved are on a scale of affecting their environment too, exactly equivalent to humanity post the industrial revolution. Populism and all mass movements, all returns to the herd, are the direct effect of the arms race between Organisms and SuperOrganisms, each operating for its own benefit. Perhaps the most terrifying aspect regarding this revelation is that you can do nothing about it. The layers at which the most successful SuperOrganisms operate are no different from the mechanisms that prevent you from killing yourself by holding your breath.

Humanity’s hope solely lies in individuals born out of the wedlock of strangeness and alienation. Individuals with distinct physical substrates and shattering revelations regarding the alien species, shining a light into the darkest caves of our mind.

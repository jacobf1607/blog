Preface:
I will proceed to lay down a few of my ramblings and thoughts down here, with the bare little intellectual distillation I have managed with my core intuitions. This will be a series(?) with newer editions hopefully being published within this year.
      
Disclaimer: This is my least structured, and in all honesty, is just a rambling of ideas that really wanted to burst out onto paper. Feel free to skip if the sentences do not make sense to you.
      
If and when these ideas become clearer to me, I will write a dedicated post for each of them. Incipit, rambling.



Re-revaluation of all values:
I name it such to allow for the reader to allocate this idea in its correct context. Nietzsche showed that the scales with which we measure our world, 1) were non-absolute, 2) they have real implications on the people measured by it, and 3) arise out of the psychological (and materialistic) realities of their time and place.

Nietzsche then proceeded to set forth his own set of values: all things that swell the will to power, all things that overcome resistance, all things oriented towards life, were good. All else that negated this, was bad.

These sets of values were worded and decried such due to their (and in conjunction Nietzsche’s) central opposition to anti-life value systems, all systems that ask the obedient to avert one’s mortal eyes from all things mortal, and to fix them on the immortal, the eternal, and in simpler terms, the unreal.
Culturally, one can say that Nietzsche was the first to verbally describe what copium was, and how it was peddled to the masses for millennia.

But one must also be confronted by the truth that, this pronouncement came at a time and a place, and is (as the buddhists would like to say) conditionally related to all anti-life systems. At an attempt at the tightrope walk that stretches across these two hills and evaluating the chasm beneath, the orientation towards a different value system is needed (which itself will, and must be replaced via its differential contention with the system it seeks to supersede). So what direction does this new difference face, and what is this system?

If we are pattern recognizing beings, like all animals are, we construct mental maps that are used to navigate ourselves through this navigate this world. These mental maps are incomplete, and are further built out as time and actions in this directions progress (these maps aren’t built out for some end, nor is the goal to “complete” this map, but instead, our wiring positions us to be in a constant state of active-building). This is centrally differentiated from Kant’s thing-in-itself; as the content of the inalienable “difference” between the mental map and the external world is not in the difference between the object-in-itself and its representation in our minds, but is instead the difference between the collective world (as a single entity) and the collective mental map (as a single entity). The benefits in this detour from Kantian metaphysics are twofold, 1) it is a much weaker condition than Kant’s, and more importantly, 2) this property is self-evident in as much as the mental map (as single entity) is provably finite, where as no such thing can be said about the external world (and this ineffable quality of the latter demonstrates the incompleteness of the mental map vis-a-vis the external world).

As such, two all-encompassing states can be identified in an animal. It is either building patterns, or is navigating a previously built pattern. There is a varying payoff ranging from positive to negative (although the “payoff” dogma reduces the cleanliness of the argument here, I wish to communicate and then sanitize later) associated with patterns based on their “accuracy” (effectiveness of the map to reach a certain end), which is the correcting mechanism for the construction of the mental map. The payoff to build out a map cannot be too far distanced in the future (i.e rely on actual events to prove/disprove it) and hence a heuristic lies within us that makes an educated guess of its potential usefulness before an endeavor at mental-map-expansion is undertaken, and once the map is complete, the same (or a different) heuristic makes an educated guess at its accuracy (bare in mind that this accuracy is NOT strictly in conformity to the current mental map, as in such a case the mental map would not have expanded. Systems and ideas orthogonal to one’s current pre-dispositions are strictly, the only definition of mental map expansion). We (humans especially) are, incentivized to build more patterns, and navigate said patterns. One cannot be detached from the other.

This predisposition can be observed across all animals and humans, primordial or otherwise.

This positive payoff is what drives man to think, and is also is what drives man towards humor. Humor relies on riding the mental map to a predicted conclusion, and then refusing the commonly accepted route, and diverging. This divergence, is a offshoot of your current map, which is now above sub-liminal, and this triggers the positive payoff of having expanded your map. This expansion and its richness in humor is governed by the same heuristic as the adjudicator of all mental map extensions.

In this quasi-space of map building, one can begin to place the absurd (a mental map construction that is completely “cut” and detached from ones current mental map. Akin to isolated islands) and trauma (a pre-existing fissure, or more accurately a knot in the mental map, which is not a particular “thing” but rather a negative existence, a not-a-thing-as-a-thing, gains expression via an external event which is perfectly suited for the fissure’s expression. I borrow from the Lacanian reading of Freud’s case of Little Hans).

This can now be built towards an overall attitude towards life. One can perish in the sorrow of the infinite suffering of the universe (and this, in so much as having been revealed to our conscious mind, is true. But we will investigate this further in the ‘Doctrine on Being’ section below), but if one was to merely identify the purpose, or the lack thereof, is to actively-build and navigate. The grand motor being this constant “Comedic Drive”. The Will to Truth, is subordinated as it is merely the building of the mental map. The Will to Power, in this context is expressed both in building out the map (as overcoming a form of resistance of unknowing to now, knowing), and the navigation of the mental map (to overcome physical resistances, and to overcome them better).



Doctrine on Being:
Human beings are animals.

Human beings evolved a vestige, which allows it to observe its inner workings, potentially to help them to better work together, live in more complex communities, create language etc. This vestige is consciousness.

For the discussions going forward we must nail this specimen down to the dissection board. So what is consciousness?
For a succinct definition suitable for the purposes of this essay, consciousness is perception of oneself in time.

A hyperactive consciousness, creates a hyper-perception of oneself in time. This hyper-perception, this slow burnt tiredness. This renders the brain tired when it reaches a point of higher potential. Boredom prompts man to action, but with the lower free energy available, the mind be relegated to enjoying only the lower and baser forms of activity.

This vestige also, amplified the immense amounts of suffering the material world is. An un-conscious animal seldom minds a missing limb, it just continues, as if barely aware of it. Instincts which had evolved to guide the animal’s way of life, have now had distortive noise added to them by the observer vestige.

This evolved consciousness, by its very nature has the ability of abstract thinking. It allowed human beings to create complex languages that govern complex systems, like government machinery, and even mathematics.

This also meant we could see many different worlds, and for these newly opened eyes with crude vision, it seemed to them like ‘better’ worlds.

This vestige then proposes something. That it is the center of this house that you call ‘you’. This was not a sudden proposal either. It has been crouching slowly towards it for millennia. It started with Plato’s forms, Judaic monotheism, then Christianity. Enlightenment. Industrial Revolution.

So far, I have merely listed observations, the value judgements and what we should do come now.

So what then to do about this vestige?

It has its utilities, and it has potential to be better integrated into our whole. We must eliminate the delimiting line between our conscious and unconscious. Propel man forward into a different era of spirituality.

Merge how? The vestige’s core has been heightened observational abilities, but for few limited cones. The empirical senses, and the pattern making machine inside. The assertion here is, that the vestige has over reached into unnecessary arenas, this not only causes a distortion, but also renders it weaker to perform in the arenas the conscious mind is actually needed in.

So we must seek to quiet the conscious mind when not needed; mindfulness. But this also has a lot of implications. Any realm, apart from this world, is harm. This doesn’t just confine to religious movements, but manifests itself all throughout your life: infinite-scroll apps, music while working out, walking, or even while doing chores. These are not criticisms levelled at them because of their innate harm, but more so, these are all arenas where your conscious mind, must shut down, but instead these mis-activities keeps the conscious mind burning, at low intensity. Never letting it really, be.

The ideal? A slow moving animal, with healthy instincts, that is capable of extraordinary feats when its instincts move him.

One must drop all ideas of a different soul, or mind. A healthy body, is all from which all else health grows. But far rarer is a healthy mind, grown on the fields of a healthy body. Who is yet there?
